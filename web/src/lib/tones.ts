// The product palette: a few soft hues used for meaning (status, priority,
// SLA, channels, sentiment, AI), for things people label (tags), and to tell
// people and workspaces apart (avatars, tiles, chart series). Each tone has a
// soft fill, a hairline, an ink for text and icons, and a solid for dots and
// bars. Ink stays the primary action colour; tones never replace it.
//
// The class strings are spelled out so Tailwind can see them.

// The names match the API's LabelColor, so a label colour is a tone.
