// Online time (contracts/api.md "Agents report"). The app's heartbeats, while a member's
// availability is online, are kept in agent_presence as stretches of time: a heartbeat
// extends the member's open stretch when the last one came less than PresenceGap ago, and
// otherwise closes it and starts a new one. A change of availability away from online ends
// the stretch. Viewers are never assigned work, so their time is not recorded. A workspace
// that turns online time off (settings agent_online_time false) records nobody's, and
// turning it off deletes what was recorded.

// beats every 2 minutes while a tab is visible and the iPhone app every 5 while it is open.
