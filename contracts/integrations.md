# Integrations (`internal/integrations`)

A workspace connects other products (issue trackers, docs, chat, CRM, billing, files) so
Ollie can look things up and act there: "open a Linear issue for this ticket". Every
integration is a remote **MCP server** (Model Context Protocol, `2025-11-25`); the catalog
is the vendors' own servers, and anything else connects by URL. Same code on the cloud
and on a self-host; no plan gates it.

## Connections

One connection per integration per workspace. An admin connects it once, with the
service's own sign-in (OAuth) or a pasted token; Ollie then acts through that connection,
and every change is approved by, and attributed to, the agent who asked.

```ts
interface Provider { key: string; name: string; category: "issues"|"docs"|"chat"|"crm"|"payments"|"automation"|"files";
  description: string; url: string; auth: "oauth"|"token"; token_help?: string; token_url?: string; starters: Starter[] }
interface Starter { label: string; prompt: string } // one-click asks on a ticket
interface Integration { id: string; provider: string /* catalog key or "custom" */; name: string; host: string;
  url?: string /* catalog only; custom servers show the host, since a path can carry a secret */;
  auth_type: "oauth"|"token"|"none"; status: "pending"|"connected"|"error"; enabled: boolean; last_error: string;
  icon_url: string | null /* custom servers: the server's advertised icon, else its site's; catalog products are drawn by the app */;
  tools: ToolInfo[]; starters: Starter[]; synced_at: string | null; created_at: string }
interface ToolInfo { name: string; title: string; description: string;
  read_only: boolean /* runs without approval: read_only_hint and not ask_first */;
  read_only_hint: boolean /* the server marks it read-only (its readOnlyHint) */;
  ask_first: boolean /* an admin set it to wait for approval */;
  auto_run: boolean /* a write that runs without the user's approval: on auto_tools, not read-only, not ask_first */; enabled: boolean }
interface Link { id: string; ticket_id: string; integration_id: string | null; provider: string /* key, custom or link */;
  url: string; title: string; actor_type: "user"|"ai"|"api"; created_by: string | null; created_at: string }
```

| DELETE | `/v1/tickets/{id}/links/{linkId}` | agent, `tickets:write` | → 204. The item in the other product is left as it is |

- Token and open (`none`) connections are checked when created: the tool list is fetched,
  or the request fails with `422 integration_failed`. OAuth connections start `pending` and
  become `connected` on the callback.
- At most 25 connections per workspace (`409`), 30 connection attempts per workspace per hour (`429`),
  50 links per ticket.
- Callback errors: `oauth_state`, `access_denied`, `forbidden` (no longer admin), `not_found`,
  `provider_error`, `sync_failed`.
- API keys cannot connect (`403`): signing in to another service needs a person in a browser.

### Icons

A custom server's icon is looked up in a job (`integrations.icon`) after each successful
sync (connect, sign-in, sync, new token), so it never slows connecting down:

1. The icons the server advertises in its `initialize` result (`serverInfo.icons`). Only
   raster images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP; never SVG), as a base64 `data:` URI or an https URL
   on the server's own registrable domain (`mcp.example.com` may use `cdn.example.com`).
   Icons for any or the light theme come first, then the smallest at least 64 px; at
   most 3 are tried. Legacy HTTP+SSE servers advertise none.
2. Else its site's icon: the server's registrable domain (`example.com`), found like a
   company logo (logo provider, apple-touch-icon, manifest, favicon).

Icons are downloaded without the connection's credentials, through the outbound URL
rules, and re-encoded as PNGs (`/v1/images`). A lookup that finds nothing keeps the
current icon. A new icon publishes `integration.updated`.

## Sign-in (OAuth 2.1 for MCP)

- Discovery: the server's `401` `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…` (or the
  well-known protected resource metadata, RFC 9728) names the authorization server;
  its metadata comes from RFC 8414 or OpenID locations, and counts only when its `issuer` is the
  one it was fetched for (a trailing slash aside; RFC 8414 3.3). PKCE `S256` is required; a server
  without it is refused.
- Client identity, in order: an operator's pre-registered client (`MCP_<KEY>_CLIENT_ID`,
  `MCP_<KEY>_CLIENT_SECRET`), the client ID metadata document (https instances), dynamic
  client registration (RFC 7591). Slack and Box accept only a pre-registered client.
  GitHub signs in with one when it is set (a GitHub App; its secret is sent as form
  fields) and asks for a token until then: the catalog's `auth` says which.
- The flow uses an `oauth_state` JWT (`data.flow = "integration"`, with the integration id and the
  sealed PKCE verifier) and an `od_integration_oauth` HttpOnly cookie (Path `/v1/integrations/oauth`)
  binding it to the browser. The callback checks the cookie and that the user is still an admin.
  A callback carrying `iss` (RFC 9207) must name the connection's issuer, and one from a server whose
  metadata says `authorization_response_iss_parameter_supported` must carry it; otherwise the code
  is never exchanged (`?error=oauth_state`).
- Requests carry `resource` (RFC 8707). Access tokens refresh under a row lock; a refused
  refresh marks the connection `error` ("Reconnect the integration").

## Security

- Every server URL and every endpoint a server names (metadata, authorize, token,
  registration, legacy message endpoints on the same origin only) passes the outbound URL
  rules: https, public addresses only, re-checked at connect time, no redirects, no proxy.
  Development instances also allow loopback.
- Tokens, refresh tokens and client secrets are sealed with `d.Box`; they never appear in
  API answers, events, logs or audit entries. Audit and logs name the host, never the URL.
- Audit: `integration.connected`, `integration.updated`, `integration.disconnected`.
- Responses are capped (4 MiB per message, 200 tools, 32 KiB per tool schema); descriptions
  are clipped.

## Ollie

Connected tools are offered to Ollie (agent role and up) as `<slug>__<tool>` (at most 64
characters), with the integration's name leading the description; at most 120 per run.
Tools turned off in settings are neither offered nor run. `disabled_tools`, `ask_tools` and
`auto_tools` keep only names of the connection's tools, and outlast a sync.

- A tool its server marks `readOnlyHint` runs as a read, unless an admin set it to ask first
  (`ask_tools`; the server's hint stays visible as `read_only_hint`). Everything else is a
  write: it is proposed with a `Preview` (`system` names the integration, `changes` lists up
  to 12 arguments, long text in `body`) and runs only after the user approves. The preview's
  `arguments` is the complete call as it is sent, indented; `omitted` counts the arguments
  `changes` and `body` leave out and `clipped` marks a value they cut short.
- Arguments are a JSON object of at most 64 KB that names each key once. They are stored
  as their own text, so the approved call sends exactly what the preview showed.
- Whether a tool may run without approval is checked again when it runs: a call made as a
  read is refused once the tool is turned off or set to ask first.
- Runs without asking: a write on `auto_tools` runs as soon as Ollie proposes it, on the path of an
  approved change (`contracts/ai.md` "Approvals": an `assistant_actions` row with `auto`, the
  `assistant.action` audit entry with `data.auto = true`). Only a write counts: a tool that is
  read-only needs no approval anyway, and `ask_tools` wins over `auto_tools` for a tool on both.
  A change whose preview reaches someone outside (`external`) still asks. Whether it may run so is
  checked again just before it runs, and the call itself is refused once it no longer may.
- Results and errors from a server reach the model inside `<tool_output>` data blocks.
- A write made from a ticket (the page context) whose name reads as creating something,
  and whose result has a link on the provider's hosts, is linked back to the ticket
  (`POST /v1/tickets/{id}/links`, attributed `ai` for the user). The step's `refs` carry
  `{kind: "external", id: <url>}`.

## Events

| type | data |
| --- | --- |
| `integration.created` / `integration.updated` | `{integration: Integration}` |
| `integration.deleted` | `{integration_id}` |
| `ticket_link.created` | `{ticket_id, link: Link}` |
| `ticket_link.deleted` | `{ticket_id, link_id}` |

Activities: `linked{link_id, url, title, provider}`, `unlinked{url, title, provider}`.

## Ticket panels (`internal/integrations/panels`)

A ticket panel shows, beside the ticket, what another product knows about the ticket's
contact: read-only, fetched when the ticket is open, never blocking it. It is not an MCP
connection and gives Ollie no tool. Two kinds:

- `shopify`: the contact's customer and last orders in a Shopify store, found by the
  contact's email (Admin GraphQL API `2026-10`). The admin creates an app in Shopify's Dev
  Dashboard with the `read_customers` and `read_orders` scopes (`read_all_orders` to see orders
  older than 60 days), installs it on the shop and pastes its client ID and secret. An app made
  in Shopify admin before 2026 (a "legacy custom app") can instead paste its Admin API access
  token: Shopify no longer lets anyone create those.
- `http`: a URL of the workspace's own (an ERP, billing, a CRM). OpenDesk posts the ticket and
  its contact to it and shows the sections it answers. The workspace's code decides what to
  show; OpenDesk learns no product.

```ts
interface TicketPanel { id: string; kind: "shopify" | "http"; name: string;
  host: string /* shopify: the shop's myshopify.com domain; http: the URL's host only, since a path can carry a secret */;
  auth?: "client_credentials" | "access_token" /* shopify: how OpenDesk gets its Admin API token */;
  client_id?: string /* shopify client_credentials: the app's client ID, not a secret */;
  fields: ShopifyField[] /* shopify: what tickets show, in catalogue order; the defaults until an admin chooses. http: [] */;
  orders_shown?: number /* shopify: how many of the last orders show, 1 to 5, default 5 */;
  enabled: boolean; position: number; status: "connected" | "error" /* error: the last lookup found the credentials refused */;
  last_error: string; created_at: string; updated_at: string }
interface TicketPanelData { panel_id: string; kind: "shopify" | "http";
  state: "ok" | "empty" /* nothing about this contact */ | "no_contact" /* shopify: the contact has no email */ | "error";
  message?: string /* error: a few words, never a URL */; customer?: Customer; orders?: Order[] /* shopify */;
  sections?: Section[] /* http */; fetched_at: string }
/* A field the panel does not show is left out of Customer and Order, and its list is empty. */
interface Customer { name: string; url: string /* in the store's admin */; email?: string /* the store's, field email */;
  orders_count?: number; total_spent?: string /* decimal */; currency?: string /* total_spent's */; tags: string[] }
interface Order { id: string; number: string /* "#1042" */; url: string /* in the store's admin */; created_at: string;
  total: string /* decimal, after refunds */; currency: string;
  financial_status?: string /* lowercase: paid, pending, refunded, partially_refunded, … */;
  fulfillment_status?: string /* lowercase: fulfilled, unfulfilled, partially_fulfilled, … */; cancelled: boolean;
  cancelled_at?: string; refunded?: string /* decimal, what was refunded; absent when nothing was */;
  discount_codes: string[];
  shipping?: { city?: string; country?: string /* ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 */; method?: string /* as the checkout named it */ }
    /* absent when the order has neither an address nor a method; never the street */;
  items: { title: string; variant?: string; quantity: number; price?: string /* unit, before discounts, decimal, in the order's currency */ }[];
  tracking: { company?: string; number?: string; url?: string /* https only */ }[] }
interface Section { title: string; items: { label: string; value: string; url?: string /* https only */ }[] }
type ShopifyField = "tags" | "email" | "orders_count" | "total_spent" /* the customer's */
  | "financial_status" | "fulfillment_status" | "line_items" | "line_prices" | "shipping" | "discounts" | "refunds" | "tracking" /* each order's */;
```

What a Shopify panel shows is the admin's choice from that catalogue. The customer's name and link,
and each order's number, date, total and cancellation, always show. Until an admin chooses, a panel
shows every field but `email` (the ticket's contact's own address) and 5 orders, as it always has;
`ticket_panels.fields` is NULL until then, and a later default applies to such panels by itself.
`line_prices` needs `line_items`. `shipping` is the destination's city and country and the
shipping method; `discounts` the discount codes; `refunds` the refunded amount; `tracking` the
fulfilments' parcels. A field left out is not asked of Shopify, nor told.

Orders and customers have the same shape whatever the store, so another commerce source plugs
into the same section.

| method | path | role | body → response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/v1/ticket-panels` | viewer, `tickets:read` | → `{data: TicketPanel[]}` in `position` order |
| POST | `/v1/ticket-panels` | admin user | `{kind, name?, shop? /* shopify: domain, handle or admin URL */, client_id?, client_secret? /* shopify: an app */, token? /* shopify: in place of the app */, fields?, orders_shown? /* shopify; 422 on http */, url? /* http */}` → 201 `{panel, secret? /* http: the signing secret, shown once */}`, `Cache-Control: no-store` |
| PATCH | `/v1/ticket-panels/{id}` | admin user | `{name?, enabled?, position?, client_secret?, client_id? /* shopify: a new secret keeps the client ID */, token? /* shopify */, fields? /* shopify: the whole list; an unknown field, or line_prices without line_items: 422 */, orders_shown? /* shopify, 1 to 5 */, url? /* http */}` → `TicketPanel` |
| POST | `/v1/ticket-panels/{id}/rotate-secret` | admin user | → `{panel, secret}` (http; the old secret stops at once) |
| DELETE | `/v1/ticket-panels/{id}` | admin user | → 204 |
| GET | `/v1/tickets/{id}/panels/{panelId}` | viewer, `tickets:read` | `?refresh=true` asks the product again → `TicketPanelData`. A hidden or missing ticket, or a panel that is off or gone: `404` |

- Shopify credentials are a client ID and secret or a token, never both (`422`). They are checked
  when saved: a token is asked for with the app's (below), its `scope` must hold `read_customers`
  and `read_orders` (or their `write_` scopes), then `query { shop { name } }`; the shop's name
  becomes the panel's name unless one is given: `422 panel_failed` otherwise. An http URL passes the outbound
  URL rules: `422 invalid_url`. At most 10 panels per workspace (`409`), 30 new panels an hour (`429`).
- API keys never connect (`403`): pasting another product's credentials needs a person.
- A lookup is one request within 3 s. Its answer is kept for a minute (a failure for 15 s) per
  panel and contact (and ticket, for http), and a changed panel never answers from before the
  change; `refresh` skips the copy. A panel makes at most 120 lookups a minute that the copy did
  not answer. A failure is `state: "error"` with a 200, never an error status: the ticket shows a
  quiet note. Refused credentials (Shopify `401`, `403` or `ACCESS_DENIED`; the URL's `401` or
  `403`) also mark the panel `error` with `last_error` and publish `ticket_panel.updated`; a
  lookup that works again, new credentials or a new URL marks it `connected`. A timeout or an outage
  leaves the status as it is.
- Shopify app tokens (the client credentials grant): `POST https://<shop>/admin/oauth/access_token`,
  form-encoded `grant_type=client_credentials`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, answers
  `{access_token, scope, expires_in}` (24 hours, no refresh token). Each API process keeps a
  panel's token in memory, asks for a new one 5 minutes before its end, and one lookup asks while
  the others wait for it. A token refused before its end (the app reinstalled) is asked for again
  once. A refused client ID or secret (`400`, `401`, `403`) or `shop_not_permitted` (Shopify gives
  these tokens only for a shop of the app's own organization) marks the panel `error`.
- Shopify: the first customer whose default email is the contact's (an exact, case-insensitive
  match of the phrase search); none is `empty`. The panel's `orders_shown` orders, newest first,
  with up to 10 lines each (unit price before discounts), their fulfilments' tracking, discount
  codes, the refunded amount (`totalRefundedSet`), the shipping method (`shippingLine.title`) and
  the destination's city and country (`shippingAddress`; never the street). One query, built from
  the panel's fields: each field adds its own part (`tags`, `numberOfOrders`, `amountSpent`,
  `displayFinancialStatus`, `displayFulfillmentStatus`, `lineItems`, `originalUnitPriceSet`,
  `shippingLine` and `shippingAddress`, `discountCodes`, `totalRefundedSet`, `fulfillments`), and
  `email` reads nothing more, since the match needs it. With every field and 5 orders its requested
  cost is about 350 points (Shopify allows 1,000 per query); lines and tracking are most of it.
  An app without access to customer addresses gets them refused field by field: the orders show
  without a destination and the panel stays `connected`. Links go to `admin.shopify.com/store/<handle>`: the customer and each order by
  the number of its global id (`gid://shopify/Order/123` → `/orders/123`).
- The integrations catalog in settings lists Shopify beside the MCP products, and a card for a
  panel from a URL: both open the panel's own dialog, since a panel is a `ticket_panels` row and
  not an integration (it gives Ollie no tool). A connected Shopify panel shows as connected there
  and leads to its row.

### The http request

`POST <url>` with `Content-Type: application/json`, `User-Agent: opendesk-panels/<version>`,
`OD-Panel-Id` and `OD-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex>`, the HMAC-SHA256 of `"<t>.<body>"` with the
panel's secret: the scheme of outgoing webhooks (`contracts/events.md`), verified the same way.

```json
{ "panel_id": "…", "workspace_id": "…",
  "ticket": { "id": "…", "number": 1042, "subject": "Where is my order?" },
  "contact": { "id": "…", "email": "ada@example.com", "name": "Ada Buyer" } }
```

`contact.id` is null and `email` empty for a ticket without a contact. The answer:

```json
{ "sections": [ { "title": "Odoo order", "items": [
  { "label": "Confirmed delivery", "value": "2026-11-04", "url": "https://erp.example/so/42" } ] } ] }
```

- At most 64 KB; 10 sections of 30 items are shown. Text is plain (control characters dropped,
  title and label 80 characters, value 500; a number or boolean value is shown as written), never
  HTML. A `url` that is not https (http on a development instance) is dropped.
- `204` or `404`: nothing about this contact (`empty`). `401` or `403`: refused credentials. Any
  other status, a timeout or an answer that is not this JSON: `error`.

### Security

- Client secrets, tokens and signing secrets are sealed with `d.Box` (`ticket_panels.secret_enc`:
  a shopify panel with a `client_id` seals the app's client secret, one without a token); Shopify's
  24-hour tokens are only kept in memory. None of them appear in
  answers, events, logs or audit entries. Requests go through the outbound URL rules at connect
  time (https, public addresses only, no redirects, no proxy; loopback on development instances).
- Audit: `ticket_panel.connected`, `ticket_panel.updated` (`changes` names the fields:
  `credentials` for new Shopify credentials, `secret` for a rotation, `fields`, `orders_shown`), `ticket_panel.disconnected`,
  with the kind and host.
- The ticket is read through domain visibility: a contact on a ticket of a private team the
  reader is not on is never looked up.
